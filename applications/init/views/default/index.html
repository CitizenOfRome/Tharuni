            the Aged</h3>

            <p >
                Tharuni is an organization working for the most neglected and
                future half of the Population – the Girl children. Tharuni works
                for the Girls who are in important stage of their Life Cycle i.e.,
                Adolescent Age Group. Adolescence is the Pillar of Life where the
                rest of it stands. It is the most crucial age in human life where
                all the skills needed for a life are nurtured to turn a child in to
                an Adult. For Girls it is all the more important as they are the
                future Mothers who will take care of the generation next. Not only
                as Mothers but as the Future half of the adult population, they
                need to have all the skills to be part of the development. But we
                often neglect this reality in the development sector and
                concentrate on women and children. To fill this lacuna Dr Mamatha
                started an organization named 'Tharuni' – meaning a Young Woman.

                        The essence of marriage is companionship and mutual trust. It is a societal norm to get married. However when it comes to the girl child it becomes the sole mission of the parents right from her birth. Some Parents would like to get rid off her as quickly as possible.
