            Tharuniâ€™s Intervention to stop Trafficking of girls from Villages of Warangal District
        </p>
        <p>
            Tharuni works for the all round development of Adolescent Girls in the District of Warangal, Andhra Pradesh. In the process Tharuni has set up 200 Balika Sanghams (Young Women Clubs) in seventy villages in three Mandals to bring them together and help them realize their potential.

        <h4 style="color:#5AB704">Trafficking in District Warangal: </h4>
        <p>
            Though never measured empirically, it is known that Warangal has high prevalence of trafficking of young girls for sexual exploitation. The tribal girls and girls belonging to Scheduled Castes and other Backward Castes are sold off, sometimes knowingly, and at times in the guise of marriage or employment. Girls from the district are trafficked to Mumbai, Pune and Delhi. Abject poverty, lopsided economic development, lack of proper irrigation, coupled with a well connected rail and road network across the country, makes the girl children from the district vulnerable to being trafficked. While girls can be trafficked for many purposes, the most prevalent among them is the trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation. The traffickers take away the girls under the guise of work factories, and traffic them out of the district, through well networked rackets. Girls end up reaching the red light areas of Mumbai, Goa, and Delhi cities. The girls who return to their villages end up with STDs and sometimes with HIV/AIDS.

        <h4 style="color:#5AB704">Commercial sexual exploitation: </h4>
        <p>
            The district has an alarmingly high rate of mobile prostitution, where girls are forced to prostitute alongside the highways. Tribal girls are taken away from villages in vehicles for a week or a month and the vehicle is parked on the highways, where exploitation takes place. Most of the girls are from remote habitations (thandas) from Mahabubabad, Gudur and Kuravi Mandals, where there is concentration of Lambada tribes. In many cases, the parents and in-laws approve this due to poverty, unemployment, lack of awareness, etc. As Warangal has very good railway connection to different cities like Mumbai, Delhi, etc these girls sometimes end up in the brothels in these cities.
            Local prostitution is thriving in the district, and it is a common sight in evenings to see young girls being forced to prostitute in SUVs.  Adolescent girls from the ST community are picked up from the hamlets under the pretext of giving them temporary employment in a factory, and are forced into commercial sexual exploitation.
