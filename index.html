						<p >
							Tharuni is an organization working for the most neglected and
							future half of the Population – the Girl children. Tharuni works
							for the Girls who are in important stage of their Life Cycle i.e.,
							Adolescent Age Group. Adolescence is the Pillar of Life where the
							rest of it stands. It is the most crucial age in human life where
							all the skills needed for a life are nurtured to turn a child in to
							an Adult. For Girls it is all the more important as they are the
							future Mothers who will take care of the generation next. Not only
							as Mothers but as the Future half of the adult population, they
							need to have all the skills to be part of the development. But we
							often neglect this reality in the development sector and
							concentrate on women and children. To fill this lacuna Dr Mamatha
							started an organization named 'Tharuni' – meaning a Young Woman.

						COMBATING CHILD MARRIAGES

						<i>“Let the Flowers Bloom – Don’t nip them in the Bud”</i>

					</p>

					<p>
						The essence of marriage is companionship and mutual trust.
						It is a societal norm to get married. However when it comes to the girl child it becomes the sole mission of the parents right from her birth.
						Some Parents would like to get rid off her as quickly as possible. In the process they ignore the other dimensions – physical and psychological – which will have a negative emotional impact on the girl who gets married at an early age.
						The <b>Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006 </b>stipulates that the minimum age for marriage for a girl is <b>18</b> years and that for a boy is 21 years.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>
						Having a law is one thing and ensuring its effective enforcement is another thing.
						Sometimes we see that the people responsible for enacting law themselves promoting child marriages due to various compulsions which betrays their sincerity to the cause.
						Every one considers that it is the privilege of the parents to decide when to get their daughters married and if they chose to do so even before the girl attain 18 years of age, it is <b>their choice</b> and there is nothing we can do about it.
						The reasons could be for security, economic stability, family compulsions from grand parents, further delay may result in losing the groom to someone else (this happens mostly in consangual marriages), etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						Every Day 25,000 Child Marriages take place in the world. In the Next Decade about 100 million Girls will be married before they reach 18. More than 51 million girls between the ages of 15 to 19 are currently married.<b> India stands at 9th position</b> in the world with <b>57%</b> of girls getting married <b>before the age of 18 years</b>.  Niger (82%), Bangladesh (75%) and Chad (73%) are the top three.
						The other Asian nation to figure in this dubious distinction list is Nepal with 63% placed at 6th position. (Demographic Health Survey 1996-2001).<a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_CrasE8A9TyWFZNSkZGb3NTbEU/edit" target="_blank">Read More</a>

						The Plight of Young Girls working in the Ginning Mills and in Brick Industry  in Warangal – A Photo Feature

						<i>(This Photo Feature was sent to State Human Rights Commission, Hyderabad where a Public Interest Litigation was filed and we could make the Labour Department take action against the Mill owners. Over the time, when this Report was submitted to UNICEF, they initiated a special Project – Child Protection Project funded by IKEA in 20 Mandals of Warangal District and could stop Child Labour in these Ginning Mills and Brick Kilns in the district.
						Tharuni was part of this successful project.)</i>

						Warangal, the capital of future State Telengana, is a hub of academic excellence with Kakatiya University and REC (I.I.T).
						But it has maximum number of child labour and is next to Mahabubnagar in child marriages.
						Particularly Girl Children are at the discretion of their parents who transform them within no time, into child labour.
						Stricken by poverty and driven by selfish motives of parents’ girls are being victimized. Girl child is looked at as a commodity and not as a human being.
						They are deprived of child and human rights. They have to struggle in hot sun, in hazardous conditions and they don’t get a penny out of this hard work and all the money goes to their parents and spent for the needs of their family.
						Most of them are dropped out from school forcibly by their parents and the remaining work in their school holidays. This is a small study done by Tharuni in the course of its campaign against Girl Child discrimination and protecting her rights.
						A small Photo Feature is presented here to get the exact picture of the situation and hopes to touch the hearts of the concerned officials and policy makers.

						Tharuni’s Intervention to stop Trafficking of girls from Villages of Warangal District
					</p>
					<p>
						Tharuni works for the all round development of Adolescent Girls in the District of Warangal, Andhra Pradesh. In the process Tharuni has set up 200 Balika Sanghams (Young Women Clubs) in seventy villages in three Mandals to bring them together and help them realize their potential.
					</p>
					<h4 style="color:#5AB704">Trafficking in District Warangal: </h4>
					<p>
						Though never measured empirically, it is known that Warangal has high prevalence of trafficking of young girls for sexual exploitation. The tribal girls and girls belonging to Scheduled Castes and other Backward Castes are sold off, sometimes knowingly, and at times in the guise of marriage or employment. Girls from the district are trafficked to Mumbai, Pune and Delhi. Abject poverty, lopsided economic development, lack of proper irrigation, coupled with a well connected rail and road network across the country, makes the girl children from the district vulnerable to being trafficked. While girls can be trafficked for many purposes, the most prevalent among them is the trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation. The traffickers take away the girls under the guise of work factories, and traffic them out of the district, through well networked rackets. Girls end up reaching the red light areas of Mumbai, Goa, and Delhi cities. The girls who return to their villages end up with STDs and sometimes with HIV/AIDS.

					</p>
					<h4 style="color:#5AB704">Commercial sexual exploitation: </h4>
					<p>
						The district has an alarmingly high rate of mobile prostitution, where girls are forced to prostitute alongside the highways. Tribal girls are taken away from villages in vehicles for a week or a month and the vehicle is parked on the highways, where exploitation takes place. Most of the girls are from remote habitations (thandas) from Mahabubabad, Gudur and Kuravi Mandals, where there is concentration of Lambada tribes. In many cases, the parents and in-laws approve this due to poverty, unemployment, lack of awareness, etc. As Warangal has very good railway connection to different cities like Mumbai, Delhi, etc these girls sometimes end up in the brothels in these cities.
						Local prostitution is thriving in the district, and it is a common sight in evenings to see young girls being forced to prostitute in SUVs.  Adolescent girls from the ST community are picked up from the hamlets under the pretext of giving them temporary employment in a factory, and are forced into commercial sexual exploitation.

						<b>The Two word Mantra – “educate girls”.</b> (The single most important thing that can be done to improve the world is perhaps this – educate girls – Shashi Tharoor, UN official).
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>“No other policy is as likely to raise economic productivity, lower infant and maternal mortality, improve nutrition, promote health, including the prevention of HIV/AIDS, and increase the chances of education for the next generation. Let us invest in women and girls” – Kofi Annan, U.N.Secretary-Genaral.></i>
					</p>
					<p>
						Scholarly studies and research projects have established that if you educate a boy, you educate a person, but if you educate a girl, you educate a family and thus benefit the entire community. A girl who has had more than six years of education is better equipped to seek and use medical and health advice, to immunize her children, to be aware of sanitary practices from boiling water to the importance of washing hands.
					</p>
					<p>
						A World Bank project in Africa established that the children of women with just five years of school had a 40 percent better survival rate than the children of women who had less than five years in class. A Yale University study showed that the heights and weights for new born children of women with a basic education were consistently higher than those of the babies born to uneducated women. A UNESCO project demonstrated that giving women just a primary school education decreases child mortality by five percent to 10 percent.<a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_CrasE8A9Tyckt1VDBPcHM1Wmc/edit" target="_blank">Read More</a>

						HIV/AIDS Campaign
					</p>
					<p>
						Tharuni has taken up HIV/AIDS campaign in the district since the past one and half years.  Tharuni organized a unique campaign against AIDS and child marriages in 81 villages of 22 mandals of
						AIDS Control Society). This Campaign brought to light the necessity for conducting more such programmes for the young women who are the most affected lot due to ignorance and discrimination

					</p>
					<h3 style="color: #5AB704">New Pilot Project on HIV/AIDS:</h3>
					<p>
						Based on this background Tharuni was assigned the task of implementation of AIDS awareness programme for Self Help Group members (SHGs), Youth and Adolescent girls in about 214 villages of 7 mandals of the district covering 84,914 people.  It is one of the pilot projects taken up in three districts of Andhra Pradesh State.
						Unlike other NGO’s, Tharuni implemented this project involving Government functionaries like Govt. teachers, Anganwadi Workers from ICDS, and Grama Deepikas from DRDA.  Tharuni has shown in the past and present how a committed NGO can successfully collaborate with Government in implementing Governmental programmes.  This is very rare because NGOs run their own parallel set ups and never like to involve them with Govt. machinery.

					</p>
					<p>
						The DRPs were given the task of selecting the required No. of VRPs for their Mandal before coming for training at APARD. After coming back from the training the DRPs had finalized the list of VRPs for each programme and final screening was done by Tharuni’s team.

						The VRPs for SHG initiative were selected from the Grama Deepikas who are working in the Mandal who are active, committed, communicative and popular in their area, preferably married and in the age group of 20 to 45years. Wherever the needs were not met, active SHG group leaders were selected. At one or two places private teachers were also involved.

						The VRPs for Youth initiative were selected among the local youth association leaders who are communicative and service oriented. The DRPs screened these VRPs depending on their familiarity with the villages and with the village administration like Sarpanches, etc. At some places private teachers and experienced social workers were also selected.

					<p>
						Warangal is one of the tribal districts of Telangana region in Andhra Pradesh.  It has about 1550 thandas, where around five lakh lambadas reside.  Warangal is the centre for academic activity having a University, Regional Engineering College and many other professional colleges.
						This helped most of the Lambadas in taking up higher education and later taking up higher posts in the Govt. and Non-Govt. sectors. There are many IAS and IPS Officers, Professors, judges, advocates, and teachers from the Lambada community. They are present in all the sectors. But many Lambadas still languish in a very pathetic state of poverty and illiteracy. Added to this, high prevalence of diseases in the thandas makes them more vulnerable to deaths.
						This is only because these thandas are situated far away from the civilization. Another reason is mostly these Thandas are regarded as habitats attached to village Panchayat and are hence away from development. There are no proper roads and hence no communication channels. This makes the people living in these thandas unaware of the modern technologies.

						OOYALA an Innovative approach
					</p>
					<p>
						The word <b>OOYALA</b> literally means cradle. Tharuni has initiated a novel method to contain the problem of Infanticide and destitution by installing cradles in prime locations in the project area especially hospital
						and health settings where children are abandoned by families who desert the neonates as they are either unwanted owing to their sex, if it is a female or they are born out of unwanted pregnancies.
						Within a short time the initiative was successful in protecting about 5 new borns, who have been abandoned by their families owing to sex preferences and the volunteers engaged in relocating the children to other agencies that came to the rescue of the children.
					</p>
					<p>
						Tharuni believes that all such cases if unattended can tilt the gender proportions at the district level and the fact that the female sex ratio of the proposed district (Warangal) is lowest 912 compared other districts in the state of Andhra Pradesh bear testimony to the fact that there is a strong need for sensitization of all the stake holders and increased need for awareness
						generation and Advocacy on all issues related to the problem.

					</p>
					<p>
						‘Uyyala Scheme’ was initiated by DWCD to reduce the dwindling Sex Ratios in the State of Andhra Pradesh long time back. Jhoolas are supposed to be arranged at prime places where the baby can be left in the jhoola which is later given in adoption to childless couple.  But such an innovative Scheme is not being implemented in the State except for few spots. Every day we see in Media many infants being thrown in the dustbins or left un attended on the streets or bus/ railway stations later been eaten by dogs & pigs. Usually girl children are being thrown as they are considered as burden to the family. This is one of the reasons for our dwindling Sex Ratios which reached below 800 per 1000 males in Five Blocks/Mandals in the State of Andhra Pradesh. Hence, there is need for taking up of initiatives which help in improving the Sex Ratios. ‘Uyyala Scheme’ can be one of them. If implemented in the areas where cases of infanticide have been reported, gives excellent results. This was proved in the State of Tamilnadu, who could utilize the ‘Uyyala Scheme’ successfully to improve the Sex Ratios in their state.

						The Nakash Artists of Cheriyal
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Cherial </b>village located in Janagoan Division, 85 km from Warangal district in Andhra Pradesh. Cheriyal Nakash artists have a very prominent art form up their sleeves.
						The Nakash artists have been identified by the rulers of the Kakatiya era and the Nizams, 400 years ago for their delicate artistry. Originally known for Sawdust Masks & Toy Making and Scroll Painting skill, these Nakash artists have become popular across the world as – The Cheriyal Painting Artisans. Traditionally, the artistry was used to paint scrolls which illustrate the history and the culture of certain section of people in the rural areas of Warangal.
						It is a unique depiction of how the caste system evolved and how people respect and follow certain rituals drawn not only from the history but also from mythology.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h4>Saw Dust Masks and Dolls </h4>
						The materials used for masks and doll making are very humble which are available locally. However, the process of procuring, refining and mixing the raw material to create a proper medium is very tedious. The process of making the mask or toy or doll involves six stages.
						<ul>
							<li>
								Sculpting –‘Poniki’ wood is used to craft a figurine of choice and give it a crude form
							</li>
							<li>
								Plastering – a fine mixture of tamarind seed paste and sawdust is applied over the base form
							</li>
							<li>
								Bandaging – after the mixture dries up, cotton strips are layered on the figurine
							</li>
							<li>
								Smoothening – liquid lime and chalk powder paste are coated to smoothen the surface
							</li>
							<li>
								Colouring – On the base colour, detailing such as eyes, limbs and accessories are intrinsically painted
							</li>
							<li>
								Varnishing – to give a glossy look a coat of varnish is applied
							</li>

						Problems of the Aged:
					</p>
					<p>
						The aged people in the district Warangal are living in pathetic conditions and unable to feed themselves. The nuclear families in the villages made them out of place and although their children live in the same village have no time to look after these old people. But the old in the villages like to live in that village and die in their homeland. This turned them in to beggars and labourers with meager wages. In the villages, where migration is high due to continuous draught, the old are left alone to their destiny. The health facilities are a far cry for elders in villages. Whenever there is a Health camp in any village, only old people attend expecting some Medicines.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Aged are discriminated in this issue too and we find no Forums for these people in the villages. This gives them little choice to share their feelings and problems.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Aged must have spent all their energies, money and savings in shouldering the responsibilities of their families. Only few old people will be wise to save some money for their old age. But in most cases, they are over confident that their children will show the same amount of responsibility that was shown towards them. We often find that the children show no gratitude towards their parents and harass them for money and assets. In the case of Aged women, they become servants in their own houses and have to face all kinds of harassment from their daughter-in-laws.  In some of the cases they abandon the old on the roads or in the ashrams and even may kill them for property. As long as such ruthless children are there in the society, the problems of Aged are unending.

						Tharuni Sandhya Project:
					</p>
					<p>
						Tharuni Sandhya was an initiative taken up in five villages in Wardhannapeta Mandal, District Warangal, Andhra Pradesh bringing together 1200 aged. Under this programme, several activities were taken up there to lend a helping hand to the lonely aged people there. Most of them were literally disowned by their own kith and kin.  It resulted in the old people feeling that they are not alone and together they can strive to achieve a lot more in their lives. Tharuni’s role was to facilitate formation of FFAs and with the help of a few donors arrange for medical aid, financial aid and clothes for the old people. <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_CrasE8A9Tyd0w5MklfSWhra2s/edit" target="_blank">Read More</a>

							<i> “Balika Sanghas” – Girl’s Groups - Girls Get Together to Be Themselves</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Tharuni</b>, a NGO in collaboration with <b>UNICEF</b> has facilitated the Formation of Balika Sanghas (Girl’s Groups) in 77 villages in four Blocks in the District of Warangal in Andhra Pradesh, India. The Population of Adolescent Girls in the age group of 11 to 18 years is 11,107 in these 77 villages and 80 Habitations placed in the 4 Blocks of the District Warangal. About Eight Thousand Adolescent Girls from this Population are part of about 400 Balika Sanghas.

							Samagra Grameena Vikasam Programme
						</p>
						<p>
							Tharuni, a voluntary organization (NGO) working for the welfare of Adolescent girls, Women and the Aged, started working in the area of Rural Development and adopted a village named Katrapally in Rayaparthy mandal to make it a <b>Model</b> Village. This project has been named as <b>Samagra Grameena Vikasam</b>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Katrapally is a remote village with a population of about 5,000 and is 46 km from Warangal. Katrapally like any other villages in the district was facing all the problems like Factionism, Naxalism, casteism, un employment, poverty, no crops due to lack of irrigation facilities, drinking water, debts for farmers, and other social problems like child marriages, HIV/AIDS, dowry, women abuse, etc.
